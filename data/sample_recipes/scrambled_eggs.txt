Classic Scrambled Eggs

Ingredients:
- 4 large eggs
- 2 tbsp milk
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp shredded cheese

Directions:
Crack eggs into a bowl and whisk together with milk, salt, and pepper until well combined. Heat butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat until melted and foamy. Pour in egg mixture and let sit for 20 seconds without stirring. Using a spatula, gently push eggs from edges to center, allowing uncooked eggs to flow to the sides. Continue this process for 2-3 minutes until eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from heat and fold in shredded cheese. Eggs will continue to cook from residual heat. Serve immediately while hot and creamy.
