Avocado Toast

Ingredients:
- 2 slices whole wheat bread
- 1 ripe avocado
- 1 tsp lemon juice
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
- 2 eggs
- 1 tbsp olive oil

Directions:
Toast bread slices until golden brown and crispy. While bread is toasting, cut avocado in half, remove pit, and scoop flesh into a bowl. Add lemon juice and salt, then mash with a fork until mostly smooth with some chunks remaining. In a small pan, heat olive oil over medium heat and fry eggs to your preference (sunny side up recommended). Spread mashed avocado evenly on both pieces of toast. Top each with a fried egg and sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Season with additional salt if desired and serve immediately.
